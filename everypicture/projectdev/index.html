    <h2>Design Revisions</h2>
    <br>
    <p>In my design revisions below, I've created design comps for 2 main screens of my project: the landing page as well as the state with glasses. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <div class="images">
        <img src="images/Home.jpg" alt="home">
        <img src="images/ROUND-GLASSES.jpg" alt="round glasses">
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>I decided to include instructions at the top of the page, as I wanted to make sure users knew how to interact with all the features included in my project. I plan for the top elements to be in the header and to have the navigational buttons in the footer.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Initially, I was going to have the layout of my design be pretty plain with little text, but I decided to experiment with a more editorial style of typography: using stroke on letters, bold-face fonts, and bright colors. Furthermore, to convey my personal story, I decided to add a popup on hover/click to talk about my experience with each pair of glasses.

    <h2>Conceptual Changes</h2>
    <br>
    <p>In earlier sketches, I had planned to have a menu bar at the bottom where users could toggle between glasses and zoom in-and-out on the background; however, this is too technically complex for me-- so for the time being, I will focus on using scroll event listeners and click event listeners on buttons to capture changes from blurry vision to "glasses" vision. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>To help my project jump more off the page and improve user engagement, I am thinking of ways to incorporate CSS animations. I plan on having some moving arrows to indicate which buttons to press as well as dynamic typography.

    <h2>Concerns/Questions</h2>
    <br>
    <p>I am having a hard time setting certain sections to have blurred backgrounds nad certain sections with blank backgrounds so when you scroll, it switches back to blurred when the glasses are off. Furthermore, I am not sure how to set the image of me to freeze on the body when the rest of the elements that scroll over it are dynamic.
