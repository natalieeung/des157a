    <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>

    <p>
        As a UX Designer with a background in Accessibility, I know all too well that it can be difficult to create a positive form experience. As far as visual content goes, it is important to focus on the Perceivable and Understandable content of Accessibility, meaning the user information is clearly visible and easy to navigate. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
       I agree with the author in the <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">article</a> that distinction between Optional/Required Fields is extremely important when designing forms, as well as providing explanations or placeholder text for inputs. For instance, the inclusion of an e.g. may be helpful for a placeholder text in case the user forgets what the field is for. By providing these extra steps, a user will be able to better understand how to fill out the form and avoid potential errors. 
        </p>
    <br>
    <p>Furthermore, forms can have a lot of information for users to input, so having measures like progress bars and standard design patterns can make the content easier to digest. It is especially important to keep consistent design patterns so there is less of a need for additional text. Features like autofocus make it easy for users to track what is going on and recall where to input information next.</p>
    <br>
    <p>One platform with a form I appreciated is AirTable. The visual design of these forms is very clean, with red asterisks to indicate mandatory questions. For multiple choice options, there are clear color indicators to help you distinguish between the choices. Furthermore, all of the questions look similar so it is easy to identify a pattern in how to input responses.
