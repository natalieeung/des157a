    <h2>Visual Thinking Strategies Research</h2>
    <time datetime="2025-02-10">February 10, 2025</time>
    <br>
    <p>I chose to look at the editorial website <a href=”https://emmpo.com/”>Emmpo</a> by Yeva Tykhonova which she describes as “a playful, interactive website for girls to explore career paths through a fun test. combining creative design with user-friendly functionality, it inspires and empowers young minds,”. The site depicts an image of a woman up close with text on both of the eyeballs. It is responsive and the zoom changes with the frame-size which is nice, and allows people on different devices to have a curated experience. While the text placement on the face is cool, it does not have any interactions which could be misleading for a user while it is loading. Since the image is so large, the site takes a very long time to load before you see the animation that changes the screen to a landing page. Designing with images can also be difficult when choosing typography, as you are working with varying contrasts depending on which part of the image the text is covering.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Another site I examined was a showcase/portfolio for the Italian brand, <a href=”https://gufram.it/en/”>Gufram</a>, made by Nicholas Ruggeri. The site is constantly dynamic and it seems like the artists’ pieces are floating towards you. When you hover on each piece, it provides the title of the piece and creates a target area for you to click and learn more. There is alternatively a grid view that allows for more accessible viewing, as it is likely this would not work well with assistive technologies. The site can be a little bit glitchy since so many components are loading, so the hover does not always work and you may need to reload the website.</p>

    <h2>Overlays Design Pattern Research</h2>
    <time datetime="2025-01-30">January 30, 2025</time>
    <br>
    <p>In the article, "" which can be found <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/">here</a>, I was able to learn more about the different ways overlays can be used and how users interact with them. In my experience, I’ve mostly encountered non-user initiated overlays through advertisements, onboarding information, or warnings—with advertisements being the most obstructive. While each of these types of overlays serve a different purpose, the placement of them is usually very central on the page on web and mobile. Furthermore, adding a low-opacity black background is helpful to focus the user’s eyes onto the overlay content.</p>
    <br>
    <p>One common issue with some overlays is the number of dark design patterns, where users are either deceived or forced into making choices through design choices. One common example occurs when users have a hard time navigating where the close button is, and many advertisements will try to deceive you by making the X or ‘exit’ a small click area to prevent the action. Some advertisements use time-based exit buttons so users are forced to view the entire advertisement before clicking out. These creators will purposely draw your eye into a big button that will distract you from the initial task at hand. As stated in the article, not all information necessarily needs to be in an overlay, but if it increases the number of users completing a task–whether it be intentionally or not—many designers will opt for an overlay vs. a full-page ad.</p>

    <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
    <time datetime="2025-01-21">January 21, 2025</time>
    <br>
    <p>
        As a UX Designer with a background in Accessibility, I know all too well that it can be difficult to create a positive form experience. As far as visual content goes, it is important to focus on the Perceivable and Understandable content of Accessibility, meaning the user information is clearly visible and easy to navigate. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
       I agree with the author in the <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">article</a> that distinction between Optional/Required Fields is extremely important when designing forms, as well as providing explanations or placeholder text for inputs. For instance, the inclusion of an e.g. may be helpful for a placeholder text in case the user forgets what the field is for. By providing these extra steps, a user will be able to better understand how to fill out the form and avoid potential errors. 
        </p>
    <br>
    <p>Furthermore, forms can have a lot of information for users to input, so having measures like progress bars and standard design patterns can make the content easier to digest. It is especially important to keep consistent design patterns so there is less of a need for additional text. Features like autofocus make it easy for users to track what is going on and recall where to input information next.</p>
    <br>
    <p>One platform with a form I appreciated is AirTable. The visual design of these forms is very clean, with red asterisks to indicate mandatory questions. For each type of question, there are very clear instructions, such as 'add' or 'attach'. Furthermore, all of the questions look similar so it is easy to identify a pattern in how to input responses.
